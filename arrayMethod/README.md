Given a Array of objects, filter the array with hero names less than a particular name and then reduce it with key as firstname and length as a value 

Example:

const arr = [{
      firstName: 'Superman',
    }, {
      firstName: 'Batman',
    }, {
      firstName: 'Aquaman',
    }, {
      firstName: 'Thor',
    }]);

Output: 

{Thor: 4}
